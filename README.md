This module defines the main data structures used by our SIC/XE Assembler project.  

It includes classes for handling assembler tables:

SymbolTable – stores symbols and addresses  
OpcodeTable – stores instruction opcodes and formats  
LiteralTable – manages program literals  
RegisterTable – maps registers to numeric codes  
BlockTable – manages program blocks  

Also, these structures are used by Pass 1 and Pass 2 of the assembler.
